    <p>
      <b>What is Android?</b><br> Android is an open source and Linux-based Operating System for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance, led by Google, and other companies. <br>
      <br>
Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices which means developers need to develop only for Android, and their applications should be able to run on different devices powered by Android. <br>
<br>
The first beta version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) was released by Google in 2007, whereas the first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in September 2008. <br>
On June 27, 2012, at the Google I/O conference, Google announced the next Android version, 4.1 Jelly Bean. Jelly Bean is an incremental update, with the primary aim of improving the user interface, both in terms of functionality and performance. <br>
<br>
The source code for Android is available under free and open source software licenses. Google publishes most of the code under the Apache License version 2.0 and the rest, Linux kernel changes, under the GNU General Public License version 2.<br>
<br>
<b>Features of Android:-</b><br> Android is a powerful operating system competing with Apple 4GS and support great features. Few of them are listed below: <br>

Beautiful U=I Android OS basic screen provides a beautiful and intuitive user interface. <br>
Connectivity= GSM/EDGE, IDEN, CDMA, EV-DO, UMTS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC and WiMAX. <br>
Storage =SQLite, a lightweight relational database, is used for data storage purposes. <br>
Media support= H.263, H.264, MPEG-4 SP, AMR, AMR-WB, AAC, HE-AAC, AAC 5.1, MP3, MIDI, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP<br>
Messaging =SMS and MMS <br>
Web browser= Based on the open-source WebKit layout engine, coupled with Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine supporting HTML5 and CSS3. <br>
Multi-touch =Android has native support for multi-touch which was initially made available in handsets such as the HTC Hero. <br>
Multi-tasking= User can jump from one task to another and same time various application can run simultaneously. <br>
Resizable widgets= Widgets are resizable, so users can expand them to show more content or shrink them to save space<br> 
Multi-Language= Support single direction and bi-directional text. <br>
GCM Google= Cloud Messaging (GCM) is a service that let developers send short message data to their users on Android devices, without needing a proprietary sync solution. <br>
Wi-Fi Direct= A technology that let apps discover and pair directly, over a highbandwidth peer-to-peer connection. <br>
Android Beam= A popular NFC-based technology that let users instantly share, just by touching two NFC-enabled phones together. <br>
<br>
<b>Android Applications:-</b><br> Android applications are usually developed in the Java language using the Android Software Development Kit. <br>
Once developed, Android applications can be packaged easily and sold out either through a store such as Google Play or the Amazon Appstore.<br>
<br>
Android powers hundreds of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world. It's the largest installed base of any mobile platform and is growing fast. Every day more than 1 million new Android devices are activated worldwide. <br>
This tutorial has been written with an aim to teach you how to develop and package Android application. We will start from environment setup for Android application programming and then drill down to look into various aspects of Android applications. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b> ANDROID – Environment Setup:-</b><br>
You will be glad to know that you can start your Android application development on either of the following operating systems: <br>
 Microsoft Windows XP or later version. <br>
 Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later version with Intel chip. <br>
 Linux including GNU C Library 2.7 or later. <br>
<br>
Second point is that all the required tools to develop Android applications are freely available and can be downloaded from the Web. Following is the list of software's you will need before you start your Android application programming. <br>
 Java JDK5 or JDK6 <br>
 Android SDK <br>
 Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (optional) <br>
 Android Development Tools (ADT) Eclipse Plugin (optional) <br>
<br>
Here last two components are optional and if you are working on Windows machine then these components make your life easy while doing Java based application development. So let us have a look at how to proceed to set the required environment. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 1 - Setup Java Development Kit (JDK):-</b><br> You can download the latest version of Java JDK from Oracle's Java site: Java SE Downloads.<br>You will find instructions for installing JDK in downloaded files, follow the given instructions to install and configure the setup. Finally, set PATH and JAVA_HOME environment variables to refer to the directory that contains java and javac, typically java_install_dir/bin and java_install_dir respectively. <br>
If you are running Windows and have installed the JDK in C:\jdk1.6.0_15, you would have to put the following line in your C:\autoexec.bat file. <br>
set PATH=C:\jdk1.6.0_15\bin;%PATH% <br>
set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.6.0_15 <br>
Alternatively, you could also right-click on My Computer, select Properties, then Advanced, then Environment Variables. Then, you would update the PATH value and press the OK button. <br>
In the subsequent chapters of this tutorial, we will discuss each of these steps in detail. <br>
 <br>
 <b>Website Development ─ Required Skills :-</b><br>
 The skills required to set up a website can vary from very basic to the most advanced. If you are going to set up a professional website for a global audience, then you should have the following set of skills or you would have to hire a group of people to do this job for you.  <br>
 <br>
Content Experts  Content experts supply the content that is to be published on the website. They design the content as per the requirement of the target audience and then, edit and polish the content before it gets published.  <br>
<br>
Content experts normally rely on the expertise of the site designer and the webmaster. Note that the content can be text, data, images, audio or links. <br>
<br>
<b>Website Designer:-</b><br> A web designer is a technical person who designs and maintains the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the website. For example, where the buttons should be placed, how the images are to be displayed, etc.  <br>
<br>
<b>Graphic Designers:-</b> <br> Graphic designers develop image files that are to be included in the website. These professionals have a keen understanding of developing suitable graphics for the web environment.  <br>
<br>
<b>Web Developers:-</b> <br> Web developers create the program codes to manipulate the supplied content, based on the site design established by the website designer. A web programmer should use a set of programing languages to compile specific functions that the webpages should do in the background. Here is a set of important programing languages that a web programmer must be good at:  <br>
<br>
 HTML / XHTML − These are the markup languages which you will use to build your website. A web programmer must have a good understanding of HTML and XML.  <br>
 <br>
 PHP – It is a popular programming language to develop webpages. You can collect more information on PHP on: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/  <br>
 <br>
 PERL Script − PERL is another language which is being used to develop interactive Web Applications. If you are planning to use PERL to develop your website, then please browse our tutorial – http://www.tutorialspoint.com/perl/ to know more about PERL.  <br>
<br>
 Java or VB Scripts − These scripts are required to perform user-level validations and to add more interactivity to your Website. So, a web developer is required to have adequate knowledge of any of these client-side scripts.<br> 
 <br>
 AJAX Technology − AJAX is the latest technology on the Web. Google and Yahoo are using this technology to give a better browsing experience to their website visitors. <br>
 <br>
 ASP or JSP – Web developers are required to be well-versed with ASP or JSP to develop interactive websites. To get more information, you can go through our tutorials on ASP and JSP at: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/asp.net/ and http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/.  <br>
 <br>
 Macromedia Flash − You can use Macromedia Flash to build a Website.  It can be a little time-consuming to learn this technology, but once you learn how to use it, then you can develop attractive websites using Flash. <br>
<br>
<b>Web Researcher:-</b><br>
You should research on new tools, trends and issues affecting the web technology. Web researchers report to the webmaster regarding new techniques that can be integrated in the website. They optimize appropriate site traffic and evaluate site development tools, which can be either hardware or software.  <br>
<br>
<b>Hardware and Software Support Resource:-</b>  <br>The Support Resource upgrades the hardware and software as and when needed. They play a crucial role in keeping the system up and running in a flawless manner.  <br>
<br>
<b> Marketing professionals:-</b><br> mostly use popular Social Media Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to promote the content and resources available on the site. They reach out to the target audience and create awareness among them.  <br>
<br>
<b>System Administrator:-</b><br> A System Administrator knows how to set up and point the protocols as HTTP, FTP, SMTP and DNS records. System administrators are those experts who look after every aspect of website development and its maintenance.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Website Development ─ Domain Name :-</b><br>
 Domain name is the part of your online address and your visitors will use it to find you easily. For example, Tutorialspoint domain name is tutorialspoint.com. Your domain name is unique to you. Once you have registered it, nobody else can register the same one if you continue to renew it. <br>
Registering a domain name can be easy because you can select whatever name you want, but what you choose is crucial for your business future or your blogging website. So, in this section, let us focus on some rules that we must keep in mind before we purchase a domain name. <br>
<br>
Rule 1 – Choose a domain name that can be your brand name, if required. Our domain name tutorialspoint.com is really branding because there is no generic keyword string like tutorials-points.com that can be hard to memorize where the ‘–’ is located. <br>
<br>
If your brand doesn’t have numbers don’t purchase a domain with numbers because there is no brand matching from the user perspective. For example, tutorialspoints29.com. <br>
<br>
Rule 2 – If you have the financial possibilities, then you can purchase domains with various extensions such as .com, .net, .info, .biz, etc. In our case, it would be like tutorialspoint.net, tutorialspoint.info, tutorialspoint.biz. There are domains that are misspelt, such as a similar case is google.com. If you write gogle.com one ‘o’ is missing, but still it will redirect you to the official website google.com. <br>
<br>
 Rule 3 – You must ensure that this domain name is not a trademark or is copyrighted. <br>
<br>
Rule 4 – Find a short domain name. The lesser the characters in a domain name, the easier it is to type, to say, to share and to get shortlisted on social media platforms and in search results. <br>
Rule 5 – Extensions are suffixes, such as .com or .net, at the end of the web addresses. These can have specific use, so ensure to choose an extension that works for your business. The .com domain extension is by far the most popular, but it can be tough to get a short and memorable .com domain name because it is around for so long. If your webpage is serving locally, then you can buy it with the suffix of your country. <br>
<br>
Rule 6 – If your domain name is not going by the brand name, then at least you should use specific keywords which describes your business, for example, tutorialspoint.com. It helps improve your rank on search engines (which increases traffic) and it also makes more sense to your customers. 
Domain Name Extensions  First domain type is Top Level Domain (TLD). These top level domains include any extensions which contain only one suffix — for example, .net, .info, .biz and so on. <br>
Second Level Domains (2LDs) are domain names containing one more level after the .com or .co suffix. For example, .com.au is a second level domain style as it contains an additional suffix after the .com that shows the website originates in Australia. <br>
<br>
A gTLD is a Generic Top-Level Domain and includes addresses like – .marketing, .estate, .fashion and .photography. This is a booming segment which is very popular recently and there is a huge range to choose from, whatever your industry! <br>
<br>
CcTLDs are Country Code Top-Level Domains which are usually restricted to certain countries. These are domains like .au, .uk, .ae, .us, etc. 
Extension also has a meaning. The meanings of some top-level domains are listed as follows: <br>
<br>
 .com – commercial – This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register and it is always the main TLD. <br>
 <br>
 .org – organization – This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. But, it is originally intended for use by any non-profit organizations. But as of now, there are no such restrictions and the .org domain name is being used by numerous organizations. <br>
 <br>
 .net – network – This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. It was originally intended for use by domains pointing to a distributed network of computers, or "Umbrella" sites that act as a portal to a set of smaller websites. <br>
 <br>
 .edu – education – This TLD is limited to specific higher educational institutions such as, but not limited to, trade schools and universities. <br>
 <br>
 .mil – military – The .mil TLD is limited to use by the United States military. <br>
<br> .arpa – Address and routing – It is for Advanced Research Projects Agency in the early days on the Internet, .arpa is now exclusively used as an Internet infrastructure TLD. <br>
In the next chapter, we will understand how to register a domain name. <br>
<br>
<b> Website Development ─ Domain Name Registration :-</b><br>
To register a domain name involves registering the name you want with an organization called ICANN through a domain name registrar. For example, if you choose a name like "mydomain.com", you should go to a registrar, pay a registration fee that costs around 10 USD per year for that name. That will give you the right to the domain name for a year. You should renew it annually for the same amount per annum. <br>
<br> 
Some webhosts will register your domain name for free, if you purchase a hosting plan from them, while others will do it for you as well, but you will must foot the registrar fees and charges. <br>
<br>
Some of the biggest registrars where you can register your domain are given below: <br>
<br>
 GoDaddy - with the URL https://uk.godaddy.com <br> Name – with the URL https://www.name.com/ <br>  iPage – with URL https://www.ipage.com<br>  BlueHost – with URL https://www.bluehost.com/ <br>  Hostgator – with URL http://www.hostgator.com/  <br>
<br>
Now, let us see step by step how to register a domain name at GoDaddy. <br>
Firstly, we should choose our domain name and see if it is free for purchase. <br>
 <br>
In my case, I wrote “tutorialspoint.com “and clicked “Search Domain”. <br>
<br>
<br>
