  <h3 style="text-align: center;">SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
  <P>
    <h4>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h4><br>
    The job pattern of an IT company engaged in software development can be seen split in two parts:<br>
<br>
<b>Software Creation:-</b><br>
Software Project Management<br>
<br>
A project is well-defined task, which is a collection of several operations done in order to achieve a goal (for example, software development and delivery). A Project can be characterized as:<br>
<br>
Every project may has a unique and distinct goal.<br>
Project is not routine activity or day-to-day operations.<br>
Project comes with a start time and end time.<br>
Project ends when its goal is achieved hence it is a temporary phase in the lifetime of an organization.<br>
Project needs adequate resources in terms of time, manpower, finance, material and knowledge-bank.<br>
<br>
<b>Software Project:-</b><br>
A Software Project is the complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering to testing and maintenance, carried out according to the execution methodologies, in a specified period of time to achieve intended software product.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Need of software project management</b><br>
Software is said to be an intangible product. Software development is a kind of all new stream in world business and there’s very little experience in building software products. Most software products are tailor made to fit client’s requirements. The most important is that the underlying technology changes and advances so frequently and rapidly that experience of one product may not be applied to the other one. All such business and environmental constraints bring risk in software development hence it is essential to manage software projects efficiently.<br>
<br>
<b> Time_Cost_Quality:-</b> <br>
The image above shows triple constraints for software projects. It is an essential part of software organization to deliver quality product, keeping the cost within client’s budget constrain and deliver the project as per scheduled. There are several factors, both internal and external, which may impact this triple constrain triangle. Any of three factor can severely impact the other two.<br>
<br>
Therefore, software project management is essential to incorporate user requirements along with budget and time constraints.<br>
<br>
<b>Software Project Manager:-</b><br>
<br>
A software project manager is a person who undertakes the responsibility of executing the software project. Software project manager is thoroughly aware of all the phases of SDLC that the software would go through. Project manager may never directly involve in producing the end product but he controls and manages the activities involved in production.<br>
<br>
A project manager closely monitors the development process, prepares and executes various plans, arranges necessary and adequate resources, maintains communication among all team members in order to address issues of cost, budget, resources, time, quality and customer satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Let us see few responsibilities that a project manager shoulders -<br>
<br>
Managing People<br>
Act as project leader<br>
Liaison with stakeholders<br>
Managing human resources<br>
Setting up reporting hierarchy etc.<br>
Managing Project<br>
Defining and setting up project scope<br>
Managing project management activities<br>
Monitoring progress and performance<br>
Risk analysis at every phase<br>
Take necessary step to avoid or come out of problems<br>
Act as project spokesperson<br>
<br>
<b>Software Management Activities:-</b><br>
Software project management comprises of a number of activities, which contains planning of project, deciding scope of software product, estimation of cost in various terms, scheduling of tasks and events, and resource management. Project management activities may include:<br>
<br>
Project Planning<br>
Scope Management<br>
Project Estimation<br>
<br>
<b>Project Planning:-</b><br>
Software project planning is task, which is performed before the production of software actually starts. It is there for the software production but involves no concrete activity that has any direction connection with software production; rather it is a set of multiple processes, which facilitates software production. Project planning may include the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Scope Management:-</b><br>
It defines the scope of project; this includes all the activities, process need to be done in order to make a deliverable software product. Scope management is essential because it creates boundaries of the project by clearly defining what would be done in the project and what would not be done. This makes project to contain limited and quantifiable tasks, which can easily be documented and in turn avoids cost and time overrun.
<br>
During Project Scope management, it is necessary to -<br>
<br>
Define the scope<br>
Decide its verification and control<br>
Divide the project into various smaller parts for ease of management.<br>
Verify the scope<br>
Control the scope by incorporating changes to the scope<br>
Project Estimation<br>
For an effective management accurate estimation of various measures is a must. With correct estimation managers can manage and control the project more efficiently and effectively.<br>
<br>
Project estimation may involve the following:<br>
<br>
<b>Software size estimation:-</b><br>
Software size may be estimated either in terms of KLOC (Kilo Line of Code) or by calculating number of function points in the software. Lines of code depend upon coding practices and Function points vary according to the user or software requirement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Effort estimation:-</b><br>
The managers estimate efforts in terms of personnel requirement and man-hour required to produce the software. For effort estimation software size should be known. This can either be derived by managers’ experience, organization’s historical data or software size can be converted into efforts by using some standard formulae.<br>
<br>
<b>Time estimation:-</b><br>
Once size and efforts are estimated, the time required to produce the software can be estimated. Efforts required is segregated into sub categories as per the requirement specifications and interdependency of various components of software. Software tasks are divided into smaller tasks, activities or events by Work Breakthrough Structure (WBS). The tasks are scheduled on day-to-day basis or in calendar months.<br>
<br>
The sum of time required to complete all tasks in hours or days is the total time invested to complete the project.<br>
<br>
<b>Cost estimation:-</b><br>
This might be considered as the most difficult of all because it depends on more elements than any of the previous ones. For estimating project cost, it is required to consider -<br>
<br>
Size of software<br>
Software quality<br>
Hardware<br>
Additional software or tools, licenses etc.<br>
Skilled personnel with task-specific skills<br>
Travel involved<br>
Communication<br>
Training and support<br>
<br>
<b>Project Estimation Techniques:-</b><br>
We discussed various parameters involving project estimation such as size, effort, time and cost.<br>
<br>
Project manager can estimate the listed factors using two broadly recognized techniques –<br>
<br>
Decomposition Technique<br>
This technique assumes the software as a product of various compositions.<br>
<br>
There are two main models -<br>
<br>
Line of Code Estimation is done on behalf of number of line of codes in the software product.<br>
Function Points Estimation is done on behalf of number of function points in the software product.<br>
Empirical Estimation Technique<br>
This technique uses empirically derived formulae to make estimation.These formulae are based on LOC or FPs.<br>
<br>
Putnam Model<br>
This model is made by Lawrence H. Putnam, which is based on Norden’s frequency distribution (Rayleigh curve). Putnam model maps time and efforts required with software size.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>COCOMO:-</b><br>
COCOMO stands for COnstructive COst MOdel, developed by Barry W. Boehm. It divides the software product into three categories of software: organic, semi-detached and embedded.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Project Scheduling:-</b><br>
Project Scheduling in a project refers to roadmap of all activities to be done with specified order and within time slot allotted to each activity. Project managers tend to define various tasks, and project milestones and arrange them keeping various factors in mind. They look for tasks lie in critical path in the schedule, which are necessary to complete in specific manner (because of task interdependency) and strictly within the time allocated. Arrangement of tasks which lies out of critical path are less likely to impact over all schedule of the project.<br>
<br>
For scheduling a project, it is necessary to -<br>
<br>
Break down the project tasks into smaller, manageable form<br>
Find out various tasks and correlate them<br>
Estimate time frame required for each task<br>
Divide time into work-units<br>
Assign adequate number of work-units for each task<br>
Calculate total time required for the project from start to finish<br>
<b>Resource management:-</b><br>
All elements used to develop a software product may be assumed as resource for that project. This may include human resource, productive tools and software libraries.<br>
<br>
The resources are available in limited quantity and stay in the organization as a pool of assets. The shortage of resources hampers the development of project and it can lag behind the schedule. Allocating extra resources increases development cost in the end. It is therefore necessary to estimate and allocate adequate resources for the project.<br>
<br>
Resource management includes -<br>
<br>
Defining proper organization project by creating a project team and allocating responsibilities to each team member<br>
Determining resources required at a particular stage and their availability<br>
Manage Resources by generating resource request when they are required and de-allocating them when they are no more needed.    <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Features ofSOFTEWARE:-</b><br> Android is a powerful operating system competing with Apple 4GS and support great features. Few of them are listed below: <br>

Android Beam= A popular NFC-based technology that let users instantly share, just by touching two NFC-enabled phones together. <br>
<br>
<b>Android Applications:-</b><br> Android applications are usually developed in the Java language using the Android Software Development Kit. <br>
Once developed, Android applications can be packaged easily and sold out either through a store such as Google Play or the Amazon Appstore.<br>
<br>
Android powers hundreds of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world. It's the largest installed base of any mobile platform and is growing fast. Every day more than 1 million new Android devices are activated worldwide. <br>
This tutorial has been written with an aim to teach you how to develop and package Android application. We will start from environment setup for Android application programming and then drill down to look into various aspects of Android applications. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b> ANDROID – Environment Setup:-</b><br>
You will be glad to know that you can start your Android application development on either of the following operating systems: <br>
 Microsoft Windows XP or later version. <br>
 Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later version with Intel chip. <br>
 Linux including GNU C Library 2.7 or later. <br>
<br>
Second point is that all the required tools to develop Android applications are freely available and can be downloaded from the Web. Following is the list of software's you will need before you start your Android application programming. <br>
 Java JDK5 or JDK6 <br>
 Android SDK <br>
 Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (optional) <br>
 Android Development Tools (ADT) Eclipse Plugin (optional) <br>
<br>
Here last two components are optional and if you are working on Windows machine then these components make your life easy while doing Java based application development. So let us have a look at how to proceed to set the required environment. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 1 - Setup Java Development Kit (JDK):-</b><br> You can download the latest version of Java JDK from Oracle's Java site: Java SE Downloads.<br>You will find instructions for installing JDK in downloaded files, follow the given instructions to install and configure the setup. Finally, set PATH and JAVA_HOME environment variables to refer to the directory that contains java and javac, typically java_install_dir/bin and java_install_dir respectively. <br>
If you are running Windows and have installed the JDK in C:\jdk1.6.0_15, you would have to put the following line in your C:\autoexec.bat file. <br>
set PATH=C:\jdk1.6.0_15\bin;%PATH% <br>
set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.6.0_15 <br>
Alternatively, you could also right-click on My Computer, select Properties, then Advanced, then Environment Variables. Then, you would update the PATH value and press the OK button. <br>
In the subsequent chapters of this tutorial, we will discuss each of these steps in detail. <br>
 <br>
 <b>Website Development ─ Required Skills :-</b><br>
 The skills required to set up a website can vary from very basic to the most advanced. If you are going to set up a professional website for a global audience, then you should have the following set of skills or you would have to hire a group of people to do this job for you.  <br>
 <br>
Content Experts  Content experts supply the content that is to be published on the website. They design the content as per the requirement of the target audience and then, edit and polish the content before it gets published.  <br>
<br>
Content experts normally rely on the expertise of the site designer and the webmaster. Note that the content can be text, data, images, audio or links. <br>
<br>
<b>softwareDesigner:-</b><br> A web designer is a technical person who designs and maintains the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the website. For example, where the buttons should be placed, how the images are to be displayed, etc.  <br>
<br>
<b>Graphic Designers:-</b> <br> Graphic designers develop image files that are to be included in the website. These professionals have a keen understanding of developing suitable graphics for the web environment.  <br>
<br>
<b>software Developers:-</b> <br> Web developers create the program codes to manipulate the supplied content, based on the site design established by the website designer. A web programmer should use a set of programing languages to compile specific functions that the softwrae should do in the background. Here is a set of important programing languages that a web programmer must be good at:  <br>
